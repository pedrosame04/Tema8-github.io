	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cicer arietinum is a significant legume crop cultivated mainly in short-season environments, where early-flowering is a desirable trait to overcome terminal constraints. Despite its agricultural significance, the genetic control of flowering time in chickpea is not fully understood. In this study, we developed, phenotyped, re-sequenced and genetically characterized a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with contrasting days to flowering to identify candidate gene variants potentially associated with flowering time. RESULTS: In addition to days to flowering, noticeable differences in multiple shoot architecture traits were observed between the NILs. The resequencing data confirms that the NILs developed in this study serve as appropriate plant materials, effectively constraining genetic variation to specific regions and thereby establishing a valuable resource for future genetic and functional investigations in chickpea research. Leveraging bioinformatics tools and public genomic datasets, we identified homologs of flowering-related genes from Arabidopsis thaliana, including ELF3 and, for the first time in chickpea, MED16 and STO/BBX24, with variants among the NILs. Analysis of the allelic distribution of these genes revealed their preservation within chickpea diversity and their potential association with flowering time. Variants were also identified in members of the ERF and ARF gene families. Furthermore, in silico expression analysis was conducted elucidating their putative roles in flowering. CONCLUSIONS: While the gene CaELF3a is identified as a prominent candidate, this study also exposes new targets in chickpea, such as CaMED16b and LOC101499101 (BBX24-like), homologs of flowering-related genes in Arabidopsis, as well as ERF12 and ARF2. The in silico expression characterization and genetic variability analysis performed could contribute to their use as specific markers for chickpea breeding programs. This study lays the groundwork for future investigations utilizing this plant material, promising further insights into the complex mechanisms governing flowering time in chickpea. {\textbackslash}copyright 2024.

	abstract = {In climates that experience short growing seasons due to drought, heat, or end-of-season frost, early flowering is a highly desirable trait for chickpea (Cicer arietinum). In this study, we mapped, sequenced, and characterized Early flowering3 (Efl3), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) EARLY FLOWERING3 (ELF3) that confers early flowering in chickpea. In a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between CDC Frontier and ICCV 96029, this gene was mapped to the site of a quantitative trait locus on Ca5 that explained 59\% of flowering time variation under short days. Sequencing of ELF3 in ICCV 96029 revealed an 11-bp deletion in the first exon that was predicted to result in a premature stop codon. The effect of this mutation was tested by transgenic complementation in the Arabidopsis elf3-1 mutant, with the CDC Frontier form of CaELF3a partially complementing elf3-1 while the ICCV 96029 form had no effect on flowering time. While induction of FLOWERING LOCUS T homologs was very early in ICCV 96029, an analysis of circadian clock function failed to show any clear loss of rhythm in the expression of clock genes in ICCV 96029 grown under continuous light, suggesting redundancy with other ELF3 homologs or possibly an alternative mode of action for this gene in chickpea. The 11-bp deletion was associated with early flowering in global chickpea germplasm but was not widely distributed, indicating that this mutation arose relatively recently. {\textbackslash}copyright 2017 American Society of Plant Biologists.

	abstract = {The zinc finger transcription factor CONSTANS has a well-established central role in the mechanism for photoperiod sensing in Arabidopsis, integrating light and circadian clock signals to upregulate the florigen gene FT under long-day but not short-day conditions. Although CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) genes in other species have also been shown to regulate flowering time, it is not clear how widely this central role in photoperiod sensing is conserved. Legumes are a major plant group and various legume species show significant natural variation for photoperiod responsive flowering. Orthologs of several Arabidopsis genes have been shown to participate in photoperiodic flowering in legumes, but the possible function of COL genes as integrators of the photoperiod response has not yet been examined in detail. Here we characterize the COL family in the temperate long-day legume Medicago truncatula, using expression analyses, reverse genetics, transient activation assays and Arabidopsis transformation. Our results provide several lines of evidence suggesting that COL genes are unlikely to have a central role in the photoperiod response mechanism in this species.},

	abstract = {The model plants Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) have provided a wealth of information about genes and genetic pathways controlling the flowering process, but little is known about the corresponding pathways in legumes. The garden pea (Pisum sativum) has been used for several decades as a model system for physiological genetics of flowering, but the lack of molecular information about pea flowering genes has prevented direct comparison with other systems. To address this problem, we have searched expressed sequence tag and genome sequence databases to identify flowering-gene-related sequences from Medicago truncatula, soybean (Glycine max), and Lotus japonicus, and isolated corresponding sequences from pea by degenerate-primer polymerase chain reaction and library screening. We found that the majority of Arabidopsis flowering genes are represented in pea and in legume sequence databases, although several gene families, including the MADS-box, CONSTANS, and FLOWERING LOCUS T/TERMINAL FLOWER1 families, appear to have undergone differential expansion, and several important Arabidopsis genes, including FRIGIDA and members of the FLOWERING LOCUS C clade, are conspicuously absent. In several cases, pea and Medicago orthologs are shown to map to conserved map positions, emphasizing the closely syntenic relationship between these two species. These results demonstrate the potential benefit of parallel model systems for an understanding of flowering phenology in crop and model legume species.},

	abstract = {The timing of flowering, and in particular the degree to which it is responsive to the environment, is a key factor in the adaptation of a given species to various eco-geographic locations and agricultural practices. Flowering time variation has been documented in many crop legumes, and selection for specific variants has permitted significant expansion and improvement in cultivation, from prehistoric times to the present day. Recent advances in legume genomics have accelerated the process of gene identification and functional analysis, and opened up new prospects for a molecular understanding of flowering time adaptation in this important crop group. Within the legumes, two species have been prominent in flowering time studies; the vernalization-responsive long-day species pea (Pisum sativum) and the warm-season short-day plant soybean (Glycine max). Analysis of flowering in these species is now being complemented by reverse genetics capabilities in the model legumes Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus, and the emergence of genome-scale resources in a range of other legumes. This review will outline the insights gained from detailed forward genetic analysis of flowering time in pea and soybean, highlighting the importance of light perception, the circadian clock and the FT family of flowering integrators. It discusses the current state of knowledge on genetic mechanisms for photoperiod and vernalization response, and concludes with a broader discussion of flowering time adaptation across legumes generally.},
